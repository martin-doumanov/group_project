## Executive Summary â€“ Group project B4

According to our best model, which is based on 7,396 observations, the price for 4 nights in an AirBnB in Berlin is influenced by several significant factors as shown below (Holding all else constant for each statement):

(1)	The type of hotel room is expected to increase the price by 48.7% on average compared to an entire home/apartment.
(2)	The type of private room is expected to reduce the price by 41.5% on average compared to an entire home/apartment.
(3)	The type of shared room is expected to reduce the price by 65.6% on average compared to an entire home/apartment.
(4)	An increase in house size by one unit is expected to increase the price by 14.5% on average.
(5)	An increase in number of bathrooms by one is expected to increase the price by 19.8% on average.
(6)	The super host is expected to increase the price by 4.2% on average.
(7)	An increase in availability by one day in the next 30 days is expected to increase the price by 2.1% on average.
(8)	An increase in score of value by one is expected to reduce the price by 19.9% on average.
(9)	An increase in score of cleanliness by one is expected to increase the price by 16.8% on average.
(10)	An increase in score of location by one is expected to increase the price by 24.2% on average.

It should be noted that although our model predicts a negative or positive correlation with price and the given variables, the direction of causality needs to be considered in order to make sense of the impact of the specific variables. An example of suspected reverse causality is given below. 

(7) All things equal, a lower price should on average lead to a higher demand for that specific listing, leading to a lower availability in coming 30 days. Thus, the price affects the availability in coming 30 days, not the other way around.

Finally, it should be noted that our model has a stated explanatory power of 58.2%. Thus, our model cannot explain 41.8% of the variation in pricing of AirBnBs in Berlin, which should be kept in mind when applying the model and interpreting outputs.

Conclusively, our model predicts that 4 nights in Berlin in a private room which as at least 10 reviews and a minimum of 4.5 in rating will, on average, cost **162.5 USD**.
